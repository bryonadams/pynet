Repository for PyNet - Python for Network Engineers

Hello,

  This is a repository for storing my work for the class I'm taking, PyNet - Python for Network Engineers. If you have questions or comments, please email 'bryonadams@openmailbox.com'

  A note on week 6 examples, check the comments in the header before running. Some of them I named 'whatever.py' only for syntax highlighting. They might kick back errors because I put the output from the interpreter in them as well. I'm more or less treating everything in here like a homework assignment.

Thanks,  
Bryon Adams

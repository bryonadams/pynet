# Concatenation. Consider the following nested loop. Nesting is great, but 
#  if it gets out of hand it can make managing code difficult.
if a == 10: 
  if b == 20:
    if c == 30:
      print("c is 30")

if (a == 10) and (b == 20) and (c == 30):    # accomplishes the same thing but
  print("c is 30")                           #  is easier to read or manage.
